Nature and the Environment Unit 1, hibernation

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:36,560
Some animals in cold climates hibernate. This means that they spend the winter months in a very

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,400
long and deep sleep. Many animals find shelter underground. They dig out shelters to sleep in.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,600
Animals that cannot dig find cracks or holes at the base of trees and bushes. If they like the

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,360
place they find, they might use it for years and years. Animals that hibernate include cold

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,480
blooded animals such as lizards, frogs and snakes. Many warm blooded animals also hibernate such as

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:13,200
mice, bats and squirrels. When these animals are hibernating, they seem like they are not alive

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,720
at all. Warm blooded animals seem colder to the touch. However, their blood is still very warm.

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:29,000
Hibernating animals have a very slow heartbeat. They almost stop breathing. Extra blood sugar and

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,760
fat in their bodies keep them alive. They eat lots of food just before they hibernate.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,040
Winters that do not stay cold are dangerous for hibernating animals. They can sometimes wake up

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,880
in their shelters when it gets a little warm. Then they use energy by moving around. During

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,600
winter there is very little food. These animals can get very thin and weak. If they move around too

15
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,080
much and do not eat, they can die. Animals hibernate to escape the cold. There are also animals in

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,080
hot climates that escape the heat. During very hot or dry weather, they sleep underground. This is

17
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,640
called astervation.

Unit 2. Falling Leaves

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,320
Autumn or fall is the season between summer and winter.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,340
The days become shorter and the air gets cooler.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,200
Trees sense these changes, so they start preparing for colder weather.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,200
Trees that have leaves block water and food from coming through the branches to the leaves.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
When this happens, the leaves die.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,720
They fall off the tree or the wind blows them away.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,920
This is why autumn is usually called fall in America.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,480
As the leaves start to die, they appear to change from green to red, yellow, orange or brown.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,960
Actually, the leaves are really these colors all year long.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,600
They look green because of a chemical called chlorophyll.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,640
Chlorophyll works with the sun to help the trees make food.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,280
In autumn, when there is less sun, the tree cannot make chlorophyll,

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,200
so the green color fades.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,960
This reveals other colors, like red and yellow, that were always in the leaves.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Like trees, animals also sense changes in the cooler autumn climate.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,600
Animals that hibernate eat a lot during autumn.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,040
They gain weight to store energy in the form of fat.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,520
They use this energy to survive the winter while hibernating.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,040
Many birds survive the cold in a different way.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,160
They leave.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,040
Each year, many birds migrate south to warmer climates during autumn.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,920
They migrate north again in the spring.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,480
Not a bad idea, if you ask me.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,040
After all, who would refuse a midwinter trip to sunny Thailand?

Unit 3 How the Dinosaurs Disappeared

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,000
The death of the dinosaurs is a great mystery.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,200
About 65 million years ago, dinosaurs lived all over the earth.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,880
They had existed for nearly 200 million years.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,760
Suddenly, they all became extinct.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,440
Many scientists believe that the dinosaurs were killed by a large meteor.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,920
They think that this meteor was about 6 to 12 miles wide.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,360
It crashed into southern Mexico and made a hole about 130 miles wide.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,720
The crash threw dust and dirt into the sky.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,400
Dust clouds darkened the earth's atmosphere.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,560
The crash caused fires, earthquakes, and tidal waves.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,800
The plants were killed.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,720
The oceans were poisoned.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,680
Very soon, there was no food left for the plant-eating dinosaurs.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,840
When they died, there was no food for the meat-eating dinosaurs.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,560
The meteor killed about 70% of all plants and animals on earth.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,800
The only animals that could survive were small ones that could eat many different kinds of food.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
Some scientists say the meteor alone did not cause dinosaurs to become extinct.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
They think that dinosaurs were already getting weaker.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
They are not sure why.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,960
One reason might be disease.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,800
Another might be climate change.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
A big part of the mystery is why some types of animals survive.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
If climate change killed dinosaurs, it should also have killed frogs.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,920
If the meteor killed most sea reptiles, it should have killed crocodiles.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,600
Yet, frogs and crocodiles still exist in the world today.

Unit 4, Acid Rain.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,920
I hate this rain. It's causing the traffic to back up for miles.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,840
Well, I hate this traffic because it's helping turn this rain into acid rain.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,200
I heard that acid rain has really bad effects.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,600
Doesn't it cause cancer and brain damage and even Alzheimer's disease?

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,840
It definitely can, but the major thing it does is cause breathing problems.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,240
The acid in the rain comes from smoke and gases that are given off by cars and factories.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,080
It's like riding your bike behind a bus that's showering you with its exhaust fumes.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,680
Oh, I was reading something about that the other day.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,180
It said there's too much sulfur in the air and that it's killing thousands of people every year.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,280
Yes, sulfur is the major element in factory and car exhaust.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,920
It combines with oxygen and nitrogen in the air to become the acid in acid rain.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,520
This stuff doesn't just kill us, you know. It also kills trees and lakes and animals.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:12,820
The acid soaks into the plants and animals so that anyone who eats the plants and animals is also eating the acid.

15
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,520
This sounds terrible. What can people do to stop acid rain?

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,820
One simple thing they could do is to use less energy.

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,920
Another way to stop acid rain is to drive less or at least carpool.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,320
Imagine if every car on this road had four people in it right now.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,320
There would be fewer cars and a lot less acid rain.

How's it looking for this weekend, Barry?

Speaking for myself, I know I'm looking forward to clear skies.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The past two weeks have been even rainier than usual for Seattle.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, Sue, residents of Seattle will be happy to hear that this rainy spell we've been having

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is finally coming to an end.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Although we've seen occasional showers today, by tonight things should dry out

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and Friday morning should be clear and sunny.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This fine weather should continue until the end of the weekend,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
with temperatures ranging from 55 to 75 degrees.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So everyone can put away those umbrellas.

Did you hear the weather report, Jenny?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It looks like it'll be a clear weekend after all, so we won't have to cancel our trip to the lake.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's almost unbelievable.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm really looking forward to getting out of the city and camping under the stars.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But we'd better get our stuff ready tonight, Paul, if we're planning to leave tomorrow right after work.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, we'll need our tent, sleeping bags, camping stove, and a cooler for the drinks.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What about food?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's stop at a store and pick up some groceries on the way out.

26

What's so funny? I can't concentrate on my work if you keep laughing loudly like that.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm reading this article in Science Today magazine

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,480
about some of the unusual things that people have invented.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
These inventions are incredible. Okay.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,920
Tell me about some of these inventions and let's see if I think they're as funny as you do.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,720
Alright. The first one is a ladder for spiders.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,160
A thin, flexible rubber strip which attaches to the top edge of the bath.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,360
Ha ha. I wonder how long it took someone to invent that.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,120
Another inventor has designed a portable seat that you wear on a belt around your waist.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
In this picture it looks like a big plastic cushion.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,720
Well, that is very unusual.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,960
But who would want to walk around with a portable plastic seat hanging from their waist all the time?

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,920
Another unusual invention is this one.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,160
Look, it's a car plate that indicates whether the driver is a man or a woman

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,160
by using different colors on either side.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,480
There's one color for males and one for females.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,120
What's the point of that invention?

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,960
The inventor says that other road users will change the way they behave.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,440
They will become more polite if they know a woman is driving.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,840
So there will be fewer car accidents.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,880
Ha. Do you really think that will happen?

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,880

Charles, tell everyone about your invention.

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,880
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,840
For the Science Contest this year, I've invented a white noise machine.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
Let me explain what that is.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,000
Have you ever been kept awake at night because of the sound of traffic or people talking or

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,200
loud music? These types of noise are sometimes called dark noise.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
Dark noise is made up of sounds that bother you so much

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
that you can't concentrate on what you are doing.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,920
White noise is not exactly noise. In fact, white noise can't be heard at all.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,160
White noise is made up of invisible waves of sound

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
that reduce the effects of dark noise by making sounds of the opposite frequency.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,320
It's like being in the ocean and seeing a large wave coming toward you.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,520
It might knock you down.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,200
But if you could send a wave or many small waves toward the big wave,

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,080
it wouldn't be as powerful because the small waves would hit it and reduce its size.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
My machine does this with sound.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,000
As a sound enters the microphone, the machine determines the sound's frequency.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
Then it makes a sound in the opposite frequency that cancels out the first sound.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,160
I hope my machine will give some peace and quiet to people living in noisy places.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,280
Thank you.

Unit 8. Inches and centimeters.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,700
Hi Julie. I'm trying to figure out the dimensions of this MP4 player I want to buy,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,000
but I'm having trouble converting these English measurements.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,700
You're really good at mathematics, aren't you?

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,000
It says that the MP4 player is 3.6 inches tall and 2 inches wide.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,300
But what does that mean in centimeters?

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,100
Well, according to my math book, 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters,

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,600
so to convert that, we need to multiply each English measurement by that number.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,300
Wait, I have a calculator in my pocket.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Great!

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,500
According to the calculator, that would make it 9.1 centimeters tall,

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
and let's see, about 5 centimeters wide.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,500
So, its height is about 9 centimeters, and its width is about 5 centimeters.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
But what about its weight?

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,200
The website says that it weighs 3.6 ounces.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,700
We multiply 3.6 by 28.3, which is the equivalent in grams,

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,500
and that converts to about 102 grams.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,800
Alright then.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,000
The MP4 player is about 9 centimeters tall and 5 centimeters wide,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and weighs about 102 grams.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,700
I thought it would have to have larger dimensions to be able to hold 5,000 songs,

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,500
but it's small and light.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Do you think I should buy it, Julie?

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,700
It sounds like a good product, but it depends on the price.

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Well, now I have the same sort of problem again.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Could you help me figure out how to convert Chinese currency to our currency?

Unit 9. Communicating Online

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,960
Computers have transformed the way people communicate. In some ways, this transformation is good,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,120
but in other ways, it could be harmful. Statistics show that millions of people use the internet

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:24,720
every day. People shop online, play games, and search for information. Studies also show that

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,280
people use the internet mainly for communication. The internet has made communication fast and

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,680
convenient. Email can travel anywhere within seconds. Chat rooms include people from all

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,040
over the world. People can even make internet telephone calls. However, this type of communication

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,440
is very different from what people did in the past. People spend less time talking face to face.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,320
They might chat for days without being in the same room with a real person.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,520
They also might communicate with many people at the same time. Some researchers think this is

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,000
unhealthy. One study on internet use found that people who used the internet a lot were lonely.

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,560
Also, they did not communicate as much with members of their family.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,960
Many people have criticized this study. They say it did not include enough people and that

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,920
loneliness is hard to measure. In my opinion, all types of communication are good. It is great to

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,720
email someone and get a fast response. It is also nice to talk face to face. We can do both.

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,600
The internet is a fantastic tool. We should use it wisely to benefit from it.

Welcome to physics, my favorite class.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Although there are 30 students in our class, only 6 of us are girls.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Most of my friends don't like science as much as I do.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,200
They are convinced that science and mathematics are boy subjects.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,000
They say that boys learn about science and mathematics by playing with toys like building blocks,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
racing cars, and simple machines while girls play with toys like dolls and tea sets.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They say their parents didn't do science experiments with them or encouraged them to learn math.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,600
Well, that wasn't the case with me.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I played with dolls too, but my parents also build up my confidence in science and math.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:57,000
They use long plastic rods, which are like sticks, to help me learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For my 8th birthday, they gave me a kids chemistry set, which helped me do all sorts of cool experiments.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Whenever we went to the park, my parents asked me different questions about the plants and animals that we saw.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,600
When we got home, we looked up the answers together.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,200
In school, my teachers were surprised.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
They were used to boys giving all the answers in science class.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
They were impressed with my science exam scores.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,400
I have lots of confidence in myself.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,000
I know that boys are not smarter than girls in science and math classes.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
I just wish I could convince my friends.

Love, hate, death.

00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,380
These things are at the heart of Shakespeare's famous tragedy, Romeo and Juliet.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,540
The St. Stephen's High School Drama Club performed this play last weekend.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,820
Romeo and Juliet is the story of two families, the Capulets and the Montague's, who are

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,940
bitter enemies.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,580
The tragedy follows when the son of one falls in love with the daughter of the other.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,440
The play is set in Verona, Italy, in the late 16th century.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,240
Alison Bourne played Juliet, Capulet's beautiful young daughter.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,400
She showed the mixed emotions Juliet felt after secretly marrying the son of her family's

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,720
most hated enemy.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,680
At times, she was happy, and at times, she was afraid.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,360
David Taylor played Romeo, Montague's son.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,640
He put on a good performance despite having a head cold.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,800
His lines were said with great feeling in a clear voice.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,440
Eric Parker was the perfect tibalt, dark and angry.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,640
Maggie Jones played the nurse.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,360
She acted the part of a gossipy old woman very well.

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,500
She made everyone in the audience laugh at her jokes and her comic character.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,140
The whole cast showed enthusiasm in every scene.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,580
The actors knew the meaning of their lines.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,040
They used body language to show this meaning well.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,980
The stage lights were sometimes too bright or too dim, but the sword fights looked very

25

real and the costumes were wonderful.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,780

The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous paintings in the world.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,360
It was painted by the great Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, between the years 1503 and 1505.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
The portrait was done with oil paint on a simple piece of wood.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,560
The portrait shows a woman in front of a landscape with mountains.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,160
Many people believe that the model for the painting was the wife of an important man in the area.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,520
However, some people now think that da Vinci actually drew a picture of himself.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,200
They say the face looks similar to his.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:50,320
Apparently, da Vinci loved the painting so much that he carried it with him at all times until he sold it to the king of France.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,680
The portrait is famous for several reasons.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,240
The best known reason is for Mona Lisa's unusual smile.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,360
It is difficult to say if she is being pleasant or looking arrogant.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Another reason the painting is famous is that it was stolen from an art museum in 1911.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
Both France and Italy send people to look for the lost painting.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,120
It was then found two years later in a hotel in France.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,360
It is currently on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,360
People from all over the world go to the museum each year to see the Mona Lisa.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,760
In fact, the painting has so much appeal today that it has been copied many times.

When most people hear the name Leonardo da Vinci, they think of art,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,040
but in fact, he was a man of many talents. He was a scientist, an inventor, and an artist.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,280
Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in Vinci, Italy. When he was 14, his father sent him to

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,320
Florence to train under Andrea Del Verocchio, one of the best artists in the area.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,160
Leonardo became better than Verocchio. By his early 20s, Leonardo was famous for his painting.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,120
He was especially good at painting colors and details. This made his paintings very lifelike.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
His most famous paintings are the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,080
Leonardo was also a great scientist. He was a good observer of life and nature.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,280
He would ask himself simple questions like, how do birds fly? Then he would try to find the answers.

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,640
He was interested in everything. For example, he studied the inner workings of the human body.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,520
He would cut up dead bodies to examine their insides. Leonardo was also a talented inventor.

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,440
He believed that by understanding how each part of a machine worked, the parts could be

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,760
changed and combined in different ways to make new machines. Using his artistic talent,

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,600
Leonardo drew pictures of many inventions. However, few of them were built and tested

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,600
during his lifetime. For example, his parachute wasn't built until 1783. Also, his war tank

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
wasn't used until World War I in 1917.

Ludwig van Beethoven was a musical genius. He composed hundreds of songs in his lifetime.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,360
The first four notes of his fifth symphony,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,560
Bum bum bum bum, are the most famous in the world. These notes are played on a trombone.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,440
Beethoven was the first composer to use trombones in a symphony.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,360
A symphony is a very complex and beautiful song.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,960
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies in all. He said that he first composed symphonies in his head.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,720
He heard the part for every instrument in his mind before he wrote the first note on paper.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,680
Beethoven was born in 1770 in Bonn, Germany.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,480
His birthday was probably in December. Nobody is sure.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,400
He gave his first public performance at age seven.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,600
He wrote his first composition before he was 12.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,840
Sadly, at the age of 28, he started to go deaf.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,000
But he continued to compose music and to lead the orchestra. He never got married.

15

After his death in 1827,

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,280
friends found love letters that he had written to someone he called immortal beloved.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,320
To be immortal means to live forever.

18

Beloved is a way of saying you love someone.

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,760
For these reasons and because of his wonderful music, he is remembered as a remarkable man in history.

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,160
Perhaps no other composer has had such a large effect on the history of Western music as Beethoven.

Unit 15. A nice gift.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,800
We've been invited to lease on Tom's wedding in August, so we need to get them a present.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,200
Do you have any ideas about what to buy them?

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
I don't know. I'm not very good at buying gifts for people.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,600
What do you usually buy people for wedding gifts?

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,400
I'd like to buy something that they have especially asked for.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
Most couples who are getting married go to several department stores

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
and make a list of what they would like.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,400
And the stores put the list into a computer system.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,000
Then you can go and print out the list and choose something that they would like.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,600
Are Lisa and Tom registered somewhere?

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, they are registered at two department stores.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,400
I've already printed out their list from one store.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,200
What have they asked for?

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, they have asked for different things for their new house.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They would like towels, linens, decorations for the house,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,800
small appliances for the kitchen, china, silverware, crystal glasses, garden tools, and a patio set.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,000
Wow, that's a lot of stuff. How should we decide what to get them?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,200
They have listed a coffee maker as one of the things they want, so why don't we buy them a nice coffee maker?

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Okay, how much is it?

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
It's $40.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,400
Maybe we could get them some nice coffee cups and some coffee to go with it.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,200
That's a great idea.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I think that will make a lovely wedding present.

Unit 16. Collecting Stamps

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello everyone, my name is Franklin.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,360
I'm the president of the Greenville Stamp Collecting Club.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,040
Many people ask me why stamp collecting is such a popular hobby.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,160
There are several reasons. First,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,000
stamp collecting is inexpensive. Most letters come with stamps on them.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,400
All you need to do is remove this stamp from the envelope.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,600
It's true that nowadays we may not get as many letters

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,080
as we used to. In that case, you might want to buy your first set of stamps.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Stamp dealers often sell a lot of stamps

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,120
for only three dollars. Second, stamp collecting

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,600
is educational. Stamps have pictures of everything from world leaders to

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,840
endangered animals

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,720
to various sports. It is interesting to learn about the people and things that

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,280
are pictured on the stamps.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,200
It's much more exciting than reading a boring history book.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,120
Also, stamp collecting can help build friendships between people from around

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,800
the world.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,880
Stamp collectors in India, for example, can build stamp trading friendships

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,800
with people from Mexico. They can learn about each other's culture

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,920
while they exchange stamps. Finally, collecting stamps

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,280
is something that families can do together. Parents and children can spend

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,840
time

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,560
enjoying the same hobby and build a closer relationship

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,160
instead of sitting in front of the television each night. So there you have

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,720
four good reasons why stamp collecting

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,760
is the world's number one hobby. I hope you have enjoyed my talk.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,760
There are refreshments in the lobby. Thank you!

Come on, Tony. Let's go to a movie tonight.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,640
We went to a movie on Saturday, Mary,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,520
but we haven't gone bowling for a long time.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,400
I know. Let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,560
Rock, Paper, Scissors?

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,280
It sounds like an interesting sort of game.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,760
How do you play it?

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,200
First, we each make a fist with our right hand,

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,400
and then we shake our fists at the same time.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,240
One, two, three.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,840
On the count of three, you can keep your hand in a fist.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
That's Rock.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,840
Or open your hand with the palm flat.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,120
That's Paper.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,960
Or keep your fist, but put out your first and middle fingers.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,240
That's Scissors.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,000
The winner is the person who has the stronger item.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,720
That sounds stupid, because Rocks are stronger than Paper and Scissors,

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
so the Rock will win every time.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,440
That's true in real life, Tony,

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
but that's not how it works in this game.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
Rock can break scissors,

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,320
but Rock can be covered by Paper,

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
and Paper can be cut by Scissors.

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
So Rock defeats Scissors.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,480
Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beats Paper.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
It's interesting that each item in the game

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,200
can defeat one other thing and lose to one other thing.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,360
I wonder who invented this game.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,480
I don't know, but it's played all over the world.

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,240
There's even a Rock, Paper, Scissors World Championship

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,400
that has been held every year in Europe since 1934.

Unit 18. Man's Best Friend

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,600
Why are dogs often called Man's Best Friend?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,880
Probably because dogs have many of the qualities we want in our human companions.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,400
They are loyal, friendly, never argue, and are always glad to see us.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,480
This is one reason why we have dogs and other pets.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,640
Sometimes, we might even prefer the company of animals to that of fellow human beings.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,800
Pets provide us with many other benefits as well.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,800
Studies have shown that having a pet nearby lowers the blood pressure of elderly people and raises their spirits.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,120
One study in Britain showed that people with pets recovered more quickly from heart attacks than those who didn't have a pet.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,520
The study also found that pet owners suffered from fewer common ailments such as colds, headaches, and fevers.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
than people who don't own pets.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,480
Pets help children to learn responsibility.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,720
By learning to take care of their pets, children learn how to take care of themselves and other people.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,120
Walking dogs each day gives children regular exercise.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,400
Pets can also help keep us safe.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
Dogs, for example, guard our homes and scare away burglars.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,280
Guide dogs help blind people see when they need to go outside.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
Cats catch mice and rats in our houses.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
Finally, pets teach us compassion.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,760
They give us a chance to show our love to other living creatures.

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,160
If we can love our pets, it becomes easier to love each other.

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,760
And that might be the most important benefit of all.

Hi Cindy, are you ready for the big audition this afternoon?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,480
I don't know Greg, I've been practicing the script all week.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,640
But the princess has so many lines that I don't know if I can remember them all.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,160
You don't have to remember all of them for the audition,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
just the lines for the main scene,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,080
where the pirate meets the princess and tries to kidnap her.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,040
I know, but even in that scene, the princess has quite a few lines.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,040
You've got to think positive and have some confidence in yourself.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
I think that you're going to get the part,

11

and that you'll be a fantastic princess.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,560
Well, I'm glad that somebody has confidence in me.

13

I think I'm just worried that I'll forget my lines.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,000
By the way, which part are you going to try out for?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm trying out for the part of the pirate,

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,040
the one who tries to steal the princess away from the prince.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,920
Oh yeah, the pirate and the prince get to have that cool sword fight in the final scene,

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,800
and then the prince kills the pirate with his own sword.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,880
Yeah, I remember reading that in the script.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,680
But at the audition today,

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,160
we'll be practicing the scene where the pirate first sees the princess and falls in love with her.

22

Hey, I'll help you practice your scene if you'll help me practice mine.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello there Terry, how are you doing?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Not too well. I'm really having trouble figuring out this arithmetic assignment.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can add and subtract pretty well, but without a calculator it's difficult for me to multiply and divide.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey Olaf, I heard that you're excellent in math.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My technique is that I try to imagine pictures in my mind so the numbers aren't just figures on a page,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but something I can apply to real life.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
One way I do this is to imagine the numbers as if they were money.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, if the equation is 753-236, I think about $7.53 minus $2.36.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's $5.17 or 517. Easy!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Wow, that does seem easier for adding and subtracting,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but how do you apply this technique to multiplying and dividing?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, suppose the equation is 200 times 30.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
30 is three groups of 10.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So first I imagine 10 groups of people standing in a large field.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Next to each group is a sign with the number 200 on it.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
At the front of the field is a huge sign with the number 2000 on it because 200 times 10 equals 2000, right?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But the problem requires 200 times 10 three times,

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
so I just add two more fields of people to my picture with two more signs that say 2000.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now I have 2000 times 3.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The answer is 6000.

Playing a game is a fun way to pass time on a long car trip.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,640
Okay, but what kind of game can we play

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
when we're going 70 miles an hour in a car?

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,560
Well, when I was young, we used to play a game in the car called I Spy.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
One person decides on an object that he or she can see

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
and tells us its color.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
Then the rest of us have to ask yes or no questions

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
to try and find out what it is.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,240
I'll go first and I spy something that's...

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,880
Hey, I wanted to go first.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,720
Billy, let your sister begin.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Remember, it's considered good manners to let girls and younger children

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
have their turn ahead of us.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,720
Yeah, remember your manners, stupid.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,640
Betsy, it's also good manners to treat each other with respect

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,880
and not to call people names.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,000
I think you need to apologize to your brother.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm sorry, Billy.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
Let's start, okay?

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
I spy something small and green.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,160
It's on the steering wheel and...

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,200
Stop, Betsy.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
Dad said that you're only supposed to tell us its color,

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
not its size or location or anything else.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,160
Oh no, I forgot.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,760
That's okay, honey.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Everybody makes mistakes.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,880
Remember the saying, if at first you don't succeed, try try again.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
Okay, let me try again.

Unit 23, American Families Today

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,640
American families today are very different from what they were about a hundred years ago.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,920
The main difference is that families are now much smaller.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,520
In the past, most families lived on farms.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,080
They needed children to help them work.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,320
Today, most families live in cities.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,480
Parents do not expect their children to work for them.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,920
It is also becoming very expensive to raise and educate children.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,560
Many parents cannot afford to have a large family.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,920
Others think that there are already too many people in the world.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,840
If they have more than two children, it will increase the population.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,400
Also, the types of families are changing.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
Statistics show that there are more single parents than ever before.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,360
More and more unmarried couples are having children

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,880
and a growing number of couples are choosing to have no children at all.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,560
Traditional families, a married couple with children,

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,440
live in less than 25% of all US homes.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,320
One reason for this trend is the greater number of working women.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,200
In the past, women depended on their husbands for money.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,960
Now, many women have jobs.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,600
They don't have to be married to have money.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Another reason is divorce.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,120
This is when a husband and wife decide not to be married anymore.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,480
Almost half of all US marriages end in divorce.

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,800
Many people decide not to get married at all.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
They prefer to be single and live without a husband or a wife.

Unit 24. Making Decisions

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,260
How does your family make important decisions?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,260
Do children have any say in making these decisions,

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,840
or do parents simply tell them what to do?

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,240
There are several different methods for making family decisions.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,940
One method is to have a vote.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,980
Each family member writes his or her own choice on a piece of paper.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,640
With this method, each person gets equal say in the issue being decided.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,720
What if the vote is a tie?

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,340
You should think of an idea to break a tie before you vote.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,980
A second method is to give older children special privileges.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,940
If you're moving into a new home, for instance,

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,280
the oldest child might get first choice of bedrooms.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,440
A third method is to take turns making the decisions.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,640
Suppose a family goes on vacation together each year.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,740
One year, they might let their daughter decide where they should go.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,900
The next year, the choice goes to the son.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,800
A fourth method is to let the head of the household decide what is best.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,800
That is the way we do it in my family.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,300
The head of our household, my father, listens to all our opinions.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
Then he makes a decision.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,660
We agree to follow his decision even if we don't like it.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,460
Making family decisions is not always easy.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,760
The important thing is to choose a method that everyone agrees on.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
That could cause a problem, however,

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,160
which method should you use to decide which method to choose for making decisions?

Unit 25. My favorite teacher.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
The best teacher I've ever had was Mr. Lambert, my high school French teacher.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,280
He was short with dark hair, a thick beard, and a big smile.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
His legs were short too, so his arms always looked too long.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
He was a very good teacher because he always brought so much energy to the classroom.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,440
His classes were never boring because he was always active,

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,400
trying to find new methods to communicate ideas.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,880
Because he taught French, English wasn't allowed in class,

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,680
so he often had to demonstrate the meaning of new words through gestures and acting.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,120
Once he had to communicate the word above without saying it in English.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,520
First, he pulled a desk near the blackboard, and then put a waste basket between the desk and the

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,760
blackboard. Next, he put his feet on the edge of the blackboard and his hands on the desk,

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,560
so that he was above the waste basket. I've never forgotten that demonstration.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,080
It was difficult not to enjoy the subject when he was so excited about teaching it.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,760
The most important reason that Mr. Lambert is the best teacher I've ever had

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,440
is that he loved all his students, even when we made him angry by speaking English in class.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,920
Whenever that happened, the students always felt guilty because they had so much respect for him.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,360
Now that I'm a teacher, I try my best to be like Mr. Lambert. He is my role model.

Hi, my name is Deborah Garrell. I'm a 20-year-old communications major at New York University.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I love being at university. I'm enjoying my courses, and I meet many new people every day.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It seems like a new adventure, and I love adventures.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I spent my childhood traveling all over the world and learning about different cultures.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You see, my father works for the World Bank, so our family has always moved around a lot.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've lived in Mongolia, East Timor, Brazil, Nigeria, the Netherlands, and the United States.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The hardest part of growing up was saying goodbye each time we had to move.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I would always remind myself that I would make new friends soon, and I always did.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've learned not to be shy.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
After leaving one place, I would always email or call my old friends.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I would tell them about the new adventures I was having, and ask them about new things in their lives.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That is probably the reason I chose to major in communications. I like to keep in touch.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's obvious that I love to travel, isn't it?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I also enjoy dancing, reading, going to the theater, and riding horses.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you share any of these interests and would like to learn more about me, please let me know.

And if you have different interests, I'll remind you, I'm always looking for a new adventure.

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Ha ha, very funny.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,120
So your nickname is Jen, and your given name is Jennifer. Do you know how you got that name?

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Actually, I was named after my father's grandmother, Gwynnevere.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,400
Wasn't Gwynnevere the wife of King Arthur in that old story from England?

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,080
Yes, she was, and her name means pure.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,080
It's interesting how people get their names.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,000
In India, we don't name children after their relatives like they do in America.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,840
To me, it's strange to see names like Jack Johnson Jr. and George Bush Sr.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Usually, it's a way to show respect for a person, but some people make it ridiculous.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,240
You've heard about George Foreman, the famous boxer, haven't you?

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,160
No.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,280
Well, he had five boys, and he named each one of them George, after himself.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,960
It must be confusing when the phone rings at his house.

Unit 28. The Right Career

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,200
People need to consider important factors when choosing a career.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,000
In my opinion, the most important factor is to choose a job that goes well with your personality.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you an outgoing person who loves meeting new people and talking to them?

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,300
Perhaps you should become a tour guide or a teacher.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,900
Are you shy?

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Maybe you should be an accountant or a scientist.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Remember, you will do your job almost every day.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,200
If you have to change your personality when you work, you probably won't be very happy.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,900
And neither will the people you work with.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,700
Nobody wants an unfriendly tour guide or an impatient teacher.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,100
Are you a moody person?

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,500
In most jobs, you will be expected to control your emotions.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,800
That's hard to do if your mood changes often.

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,300
In that case, you might want to work alone.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,500
Perhaps you could be a writer or an artist.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,800
There are other factors to consider, such as salary and status.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,800
However, what good is a large salary or high status if you don't like your job?

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,300
You should consider your personality, find out what you are very good at doing,

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
and then find the right career to go with all this.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Too many people choose a career because it pays well.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Too often, they find they don't like their jobs.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,900
But by then, they feel like they're in a trap and they can't escape.

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,400
Finding a good career is important.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Think about it and choose carefully.

Unit 29, Body Language

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,100
Did you know that words are not the only thing we use to communicate?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,600
Most of our messages are sent through body language.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:18,000
Only about 10% of communication is done through the actual words of a conversation.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
Isn't that strange?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,400
If we understand body language well,

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,500
we can learn a lot more about what other people really think.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,700
We can also use body language to send the right message to others.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,500
Have you ever felt disliked for someone without knowing why?

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, he or she might have been sending out a negative message through body language.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What kind of things should you look for if you want to understand body language?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
First, look at people's eyes.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,600
If people are lying, they may not look directly at the person they are talking to

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
and the pupils of their eyes may shrink.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Next, look at people's arms.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Arms crossed in front of the body might mean a person is unfriendly or afraid.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,100
He or she might be trying to say,

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,600
Stay away.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,300
If the arms are by the side or at the back of the body,

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,900
the person might be saying,

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,100
Come closer,

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,500
I won't hurt you.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,600
But keep in mind that there is no accurate way to interpret body language all the time.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Sometimes, talking is still the best way to communicate.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,500
However, knowing about body language will improve the way you communicate

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
and help you understand other people better.

Unit 30, Veterinarians

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,720
If you like animals and science, you might want to be a veterinarian.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
Veterinarians are animal doctors.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
They take care of sick and injured animals.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,880
Like doctors, vets perform surgery and give medicine.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,280
When an animal is sick, vets examine it to find out why.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,200
They look for clues in the way an animal looks and acts.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,880
For example, if a dog is walking in a strange way, it might have injured its leg.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,640
Vets need to observe animals carefully since animals cannot speak to tell anyone what is wrong.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,440
Vets prevent health problems in animals by giving vaccinations and checkups and fixing teeth.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,360
They also teach owners how to feed and train their animals.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,200
Vets use special tools to perform surgery.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,080
They fix broken bones, take out tumors, take x-rays and treat wounds.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,720
Most vets treat small pets, including dogs and cats.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,760
A few vets focus on large animals such as sheep, cows and horses.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
Large animal vets usually drive to ranches and stables where their patients live.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,480
Often they help when the animals give birth.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Vets who work with large animals often work outside in all kinds of weather.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
A few vets work in zoos and aquariums.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,800
They care for zebras, sharks and other wild creatures.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
Because animals can get sick at any time, vets often work long hours.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
Many vets like their work because they can be with animals every day,

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,400
even though sick animals can sometimes bite or kick their vets.

I'm sorry you're not feeling well. What's the problem?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I have a stomach ache, my head hurts, and I have a sore throat.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, we'd better take your temperature and make sure you don't have a fever.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Keep this thermometer under your tongue for a minute or two.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Remind me to call your teacher and tell her you're sick later on today.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Alright, let's check.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh dear, you've got a fever. Your temperature is 103, so I think we need to give Dr. Thompson a call.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't understand how my head can be so hot when my body feels so cold.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's called the chills, and they often come along with fever. You've certainly got a fever.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But what about my stomach ache and my sore throat?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, that's another reason we need to go see Dr. Thompson, because when you have a stomach ache, fever, chills, and a sore throat,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
it usually means that you have something more serious than a common cold.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think you've probably got the flu.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I hope it's not too serious, because we've got a basketball game Thursday, and the coach told me that I'll probably start.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you want to recover from the flu and time for your game, you'd better get plenty of rest.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Take the medicine the doctor gives you and drink plenty of water.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I promise I will, Mom. Let's go and see Dr. Thompson now.

Unit 32. Why do we sneeze?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,400
A sneeze is a very interesting thing.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,600
We use many different muscles when we sneeze.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,300
These include stomach muscles, throat muscles, and eye muscles.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,500
Remember, our eyes always close during a sneeze.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,400
A sneeze begins when something gets inside your nose like a tiny particle of dust.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,100
Your nose sends a message to your brain.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,100
Your brain sends messages to the muscles,

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,500
getting them to work together in the correct order.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,900
When you sneeze, the dust that was in your nose flies out as fast as 100 miles an hour.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Usually, something like dust or cold air makes a sneeze,

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,600
but some people sneeze whenever they look at the sun.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,100
Some people think that your heart stops when you sneeze.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,300
Actually, it really doesn't, but sometimes it might feel like it does.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,100
After someone sneezes, people often say,

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,700
bless you or God bless you.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,600
To bless someone means to wish them good and special things.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,800
Why do people say this?

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Long ago, people believed that this saying kept bad things from flying down your throat.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,200
Another story is that people thought this saying would help keep the person who sneezed

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,500
from getting a very serious disease called the plague.

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,100
At that time, the plague was killing thousands of people.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,300
It was thought that saying God bless you would protect people from getting this awful disease.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,100
Today, the saying is simply a nice way to wish someone well.

My name is Michael Bryce and I love to ski and snowboard.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,840
I am 16 years old and I have been skiing since I was 5 and snowboarding since I was 8.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,720
Both my parents like skiing and my older brother like snowboarding.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
In my opinion, snowboarding is more fun and exciting than skiing.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,480
When I ski, it feels really easy to control where I go and how I move.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,480
The ski poles make it very simple to change my direction.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
There are no poles in snowboarding however, so when you snowboard,

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,640
you have to understand the snow very well to make sure you don't fall.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,120
The feeling I get while I'm snowboarding is more exciting than when I'm skiing

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,400
because I like having less control.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,280
I enjoy the challenge.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,720
I never know what's going to happen.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,920
This makes it more exciting.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,880
Some people think that the reduced amount of control in snowboarding

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,960
makes the sport more dangerous.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,680
But in my opinion, snowboarding is actually safer than skiing

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,320
because when you ski, you are standing on two skis.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,400
If you fall while on skis, it is very easy to break your bones

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,720
by getting your skis stuck in the snow.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,360
On a snowboard, your legs stay together even when you fall.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,160
While I still love to ski, I like snowboarding much better.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,080
It is more fun and exciting and maybe even safer than skiing.

Unit 34. A nice cup of tea.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Could I offer you a cup of tea?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,600
Yes, thank you very much. What kind do you have?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,600
I have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, and Darjeeling.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
Those are all black teas. Do you have any green tea?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry, I don't really like green tea.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,000
How could you not like green tea? It's so much easier to drink than black tea.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,600
I just don't think green tea tastes as good as black tea.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Green tea has a simple flavor, but black tea has many kinds of flavors.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,600
Well, I don't taste many flavors when I drink black tea. It just tastes bitter to me.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Then you should drink more black tea, because after drinking it for a while, you begin to appreciate its flavor.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,600
Whatever its flavor, black tea can't be nearly as healthy as green tea.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:01,600
I read about a study last week that showed people who drink green tea are less likely to get serious diseases like cancer or heart disease.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,200
Well, history tells us that in the past, good black tea has been considered more valuable than gold.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Wars have been started over it.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Really? Which wars?

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
The American Revolution.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,600
The American Revolution had nothing to do with tea.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:27,600
One of the things that started the Revolutionary War was an incident where a group of Americans dumped a British shipment of tea into the ocean in Boston.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,800
This was called the Boston Tea Party, and it had nothing to do with green tea.

Unit 35, The Injury

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,040
I've just returned from the doctor's office and he told me that because of my injury,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,920
I will have to miss the next two weeks of basketball.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm really disappointed.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,760
Last night, I heard my ankle during a very exciting game against West High School.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
It was five minutes before the end of the game.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
The score was 60-60.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,840
I had the ball and I heard my coach shouting at me to shoot.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
So I started to jump, but suddenly I found myself lying flat on my back on the court.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,320
A West High player had accidentally knocked me down.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
I tried to stand up, but my ankle hurt so much that I was unable to walk.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
Two of my teammates had to help me leave the court.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,880
My ankle started to swell up, so the team doctor brought me a bag of ice to put on it.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,880
The ice was cold, but it felt good on my ankle.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,600
When the swelling on my ankle reduced a little,

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,280
my coach asked the doctor if he thought I would be able to play anymore.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,640
But the doctor replied that I would have to sit out the rest of the game

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
and come to see him the next day.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,760
Not only did I receive an injury, but we also lost the game by a score of 68-66.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
What a disappointing night.

Hey Sheena, I haven't seen you for ages. What's new? Where are you going with all those suitcases?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hi Mark, it's been a while since the last time we ran into each other.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm bringing these suitcases home to pack because my family is preparing to move across the bay to Port Anderson.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Really? How are you going to transport all your furniture?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm not sure. I considered hiring a moving van, but someone told me it might be more convenient to rent a huge container and ship everything across.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The details are a bit complicated because we've got so many boxes.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, when my sister and brother-in-law moved to Dallas last year, they sent all their furniture and heavy items by cargo flight.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They hauled it there on a massive cargo plane, then rented a truck and picked it up at the airport after they arrived.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's interesting, but the problem is that we have so much junk, we might need two cargo planes.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, however you get it there, it sounds like you'll need help once you get it to the other side.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've got a friend there who owns a self-serve truck company. He can rent you a truck at a discount rate. Which day are you moving?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Next Saturday.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm free that day, so I'll help you out. I've still got my small truck, so I can haul some stuff for you too.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thanks, Mark. That would be great.

Unit 37. Wear your seatbelt.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,360
Some people think that the government should require passengers by law to wear seatbelts in cars and taxis.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,360
They say that seatbelts save lives and money.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,480
Statistics show that 60% of people killed in car accidents were not wearing seatbelts.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,320
Statistics also show that most people who wear seatbelts survive.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,320
In the past 30 years, seatbelts have saved almost $600 billion in medical costs.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,160
The average car accident costs $820 for each person in the United States.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,840
Some states require people to wear seatbelts.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,600
In those states, about 80% of the passengers follow the law.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
However, other people think it's wrong to require a seatbelt used by law.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,920
They say that passengers should decide for themselves.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,560
Many of these people agree that seatbelts save lives,

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,800
but they don't think the government has the right to force people to wear them.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,480
They point out that smoking cigarettes is also unhealthy,

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,000
but the government lets adults smoke if they want to.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,040
Leaders cannot force people to do what's good, they argue.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,080
It's better to educate people so they will want to wear seatbelts.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,800
Those who want seatbelt laws say that the right to public safety is more important

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,760
than the individual's right to free choice.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,000
But their opponents say people must be careful to protect their individual rights.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,720
They should decide how to live their lives, not the government.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
What is your opinion on this?

Hey Carl, I'm surprised to see you here.

Jeremy told me that you were on vacation.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,840
Hi Shelly, we were visiting some relatives in Sydney, but we returned last night.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,360
Oh, I've wanted to go to Australia ever since I was little. Tell me what it was like.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,720
It was fantastic. We fed kangaroos, walked through rainforests, and swam in the ocean.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,400
What was really great was when we took a train to Brisbane to see the Great Barrier Reef.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,000
I've heard that flights to Australia are pretty expensive.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,080
My dad knows someone who works for a Qantas Airlines, so we were able to get a good deal.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,680
The tickets were only $800 per person for a round trip.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
Wow, that is a good deal.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,920
When we went on vacation to Bangkok last year, it cost $1000 for a round trip ticket,

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,560
and Thailand's closer than Australia.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,040
What did you like best about Thailand?

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,320
Well, the food was delicious, and riding elephants was exciting,

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,120
but I'd have to say that the beach was the best part.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
The only unpleasant part of the trip was after we got home,

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,960
when we found out that the airline had lost some of our luggage.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,800
My father's suitcase and my sister's backpack were missing.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,880
So, the airline lost two pieces of luggage?

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
How long did it take you to get them back?

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,560
Three days.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,440
But the good news is that when they finally found them,

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,920
they delivered them right to our front door.

Airplane travelers can choose between three kinds of tickets.

First class, Business class, and Economy class.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,040
Most people buy Economy class tickets.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,740
They are cheaper, so travelers can go to more places more often.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,740
Business class is more expensive, with good seats and good service.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,540
First class is very expensive,

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,280
but offers very comfortable seats and excellent service.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,540
In Economy class, the seats are small and close together.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,540
There is not much leg room.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,780
In First class, the seats are huge and wider apart.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,580
There is lots of room for passengers to stretch their legs.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,880
Economy class passengers usually must all watch the same movie.

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,280
First class passengers have their own TVs,

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,020
and each person can watch different movies.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,020
Economy class passengers eat cheaper food.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,020
First class passengers are served delicious fresh food.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,520
It is difficult to sleep in Economy class because of the small seats and all the noise.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,020
In First class, the large seats can be pushed back to make a comfortable bed.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,520
There is a curtain between sections, so it is nice and quiet.

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,260
Economy class is a good choice for short flights within the same country.

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Business class or First class is a good choice for business travelers

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,260
taking an international flight across an ocean.

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,260
These people often have to get off the plane and go right to work.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,260
For them, it is important to arrive fresh, rested, and ready for a full, exciting day.

For kids, we have shows each day with their favorite TV friends like Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Elmo.

12

Playing with television characters isn't the only activity children will enjoy.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,960
They can play volleyball, swim in one of our three huge pools or take dancing and art classes.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,600
There's so much variety, the kids can try a new activity each day.

15

Mom and dad can join them or rest in lounge chairs on our wide ship deck.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,080
On shore, you can shop, swim and enjoy fresh food while you learn all about island life.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,760
With four to seven hours on shore each day, you'll have plenty of time to explore each island.

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,520
Does this sound exciting? It is!

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,040
So, when it's time to plan your next vacation, remember Family Cruise Line.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,440
It will be a trip your family will never forget.
