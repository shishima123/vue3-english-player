Unit 1 A Big Responsibility

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,080
Mom, can I get a puppy?

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,520
No, Billy. Taking care of a pet is a big responsibility.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,400
I promise to take good care of him, and you won't have to remind me to do things for him.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,840
A dog isn't a toy that you play with for a while.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,480
He will be part of our life for the next 10 or 20 years.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,480
He is a living creature.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,280
I understand that, Mom.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
I promise to feed him every morning and take him for walks every afternoon.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
That's part of the responsibility, but there's more.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
He needs a license and has to go to the vet to get shots.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,800
A dog also needs companionship.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,160
You can't go off with your friends and leave him locked up in the house all day.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,840
I understand, Mom.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,440
I have almost $100 in the bank, so I can pay for his license and shots now.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,480
There are other expenses too.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,800
Dog food is rather expensive.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Well, I have my job mowing lawns, and I'll get a newspaper route.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,200
I think we should discuss this with your father when he gets home.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
This is a family decision.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Okay, Mom. Thanks!

Unit 2. Elephants are amazing.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,080
Elephants are interesting. They are intelligent. They also have a great memory.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
You should always be kind to elephants.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,280
They remember everything. A woman from India told me a story.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,640
When she was a little girl, she knew of an evil elephant keeper.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,880
He often hit his elephant. He was very mean and cruel to the elephant.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,840
Then the evil keeper sold the elephant. The new keeper was a very kind man.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,720
Many years later, the evil keeper met the elephant again.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,360
The elephant remembered the evil man. He picked up a stone with his trunk

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,720
and threw it at the evil man. The elephant still knew the man, even after so many years.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,560
Elephants help each other too. Elephants use a special sound.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,040
The sound is so low that people cannot hear it. This sound travels really far.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,600
Groups of elephants can communicate with each other, even if they are far apart.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,640
This is very useful because it helps the elephants to find water and food.

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
The elephants cooperate to help each other.

Ants, ants, everywhere.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,740
Hello, Mrs. Wilson. How are you?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm worried, Brianna.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,260
Thousands of ants are all over my patio.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,080
That's quite a problem.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,800
What's worse is that my daughter's birthday party is in a few days,

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,180
and I wanted to have it on the patio.

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,640
Why don't you call an exterminator?

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,440
I would, but I don't want all those hazardous chemicals around my children.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,520
It's harmful and unhealthy.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,640
I also don't want dangerous substances to seep into the garden.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,760
I usually don't have problems with ants, and I don't use any chemicals.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,320
What's your secret?

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,760
Well, ants are difficult to control, so I planted a lot of mint plants near my deck.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,760
I also use cinnamon and cayenne pepper.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
I just sprinkle them around the places I don't want ants.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
Some people have tried it and said it worked.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
Others said that they needed to try something else.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
I think it's worth a try.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,120
I would rather use cinnamon and mint around my patio than some hazardous chemicals.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,320
Besides, I don't mind having the ants in the yard.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,640
I simply don't want them coming to the birthday party.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,480
Would you mind helping me?

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,080
It would be a pleasure.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,400
I have a lot of cinnamon at home, and I can run to the store to get the plants for you.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
Thank you, Brianna. You're such a thoughtful person.

Unit 4, The Oil Spill

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,600
My best friend Katie lives near a beautiful white sand beach.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Her parents take us there every summer.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,300
The water is clean and refreshing.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,900
We have a lot of fun in the waves.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,000
Last year, there was an oil spill at Katie's beach.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
We volunteered at the beach to clean up the oil

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,900
and help the birds that were caught in the spill.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,600
When we arrived at the beach that day,

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,700
the water was slick with oil and the white sand had turned black.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,800
It was an ugly sight.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,400
At first, the rescue workers would not let us on the beach.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,300
We had to watch from a distance.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,400
We watched as they put a huge float in the water called a boom.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,100
This device kept the oil slick from spreading.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
Once they stopped the slick,

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,900
we were allowed on the beach to help.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,300
Each of us was given a broom.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,000
We swept the oil into a pile.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,300
The workers took it away in big trucks.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,700
We all worked very hard that day to restore the beach.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,800
Once the oil was removed,

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,900
the birds that had been caught in the oil had to be helped.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,400
The workers showed us how to remove the oil from their wings.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,800
Then the birds could fly away to safety.

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,100
We were very proud of ourselves that day.

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,200
We helped save our beautiful beach and the birds who visited it.

Unit 5, The Amazing Amazon

The Amazon is an amazing river.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,640
It is unique in many ways.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,000
It is the second longest river in the world.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,880
It is 6,500 kilometers long.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,000
It starts up in the Andes Mountains.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,800
Its drainage basin, the area of land that collects water,

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,800
covers 40% of South America.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
The Amazon River has many small rivers that supply it with water.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,360
It is the widest river in the world.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,400
The river rises more than 9 meters during the rainy season.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,120
It overflows its banks.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,640
It floods large areas of the rainforest.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,360
During that time, in some parts, it has a width of up to 40 kilometers.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,720
The Amazon River is over 325 kilometers wide at its mouth.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,200
It has more water than any other river in the world.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
The Amazon River is also home to many animals.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,440
Over 2,000 types of fish live in the Amazon River.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,800
One kind of fish is the piranha.

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,680
The piranha is a terrifying fish.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
A piranha grows up to 60 centimeters long.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,840
It hunts in a group.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,200
A group of piranha can kill and eat cattle in a matter of minutes.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,400
They are so efficient that only the bones are left.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,000
This fish is one of the most dangerous creatures in the Amazon River.

You know, I think you might want to go to the library and look at some books.

You don't really know what you are looking at unless you are at a reliable site.

It's safer to get some books first and then search for more information.

Grandma, I love you, but I think you're a little old-fashioned.

12

Look at all this great information. My report is on Albert Einstein.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, according to the site, he was born in 1979, came up with a theory of relatives,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your information is wrong. Albert Einstein was born in 1879 and developed the theory of general relativity.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He won the Nobel Prize in 1921.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow! That means all this stuff is inaccurate. How did you know all that?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Come with me to the library and I'll help you find the books with those facts.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000

Hi, I'd like to see your calculators.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,100
Did you have a certain model in mind, ma'am?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,840
I'm not thinking of any specific model.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,400
I want something simple for basic math.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,400
Is it for personal use?

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,500
Yes, I just need it for shopping and keeping track of my bills.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,300
Well, the great thing is that these simple calculators are very inexpensive and small.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Here is a solar model that never needs batteries.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,600
It is thin, too.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,600
It's too small. I can't read the numbers very easily.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,100
How about this one? It is a pocket calculator.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,600
It's a bit bigger. The display is easier to read.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Yes, I can see the numbers better. It is easier to hold, too.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,100
Is it also solar?

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,300
Yes, it is. It is battery-powered as well.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
It has an 8-digit display.

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,300
This calculator also has a memory key.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,800
How much is it?

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,700
It is only $5 plus tax. It comes with a one-year warranty.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I'll take it.

Unit 8 Racing Robots

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,960
I have been interested in robots for as long as I can remember.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,560
The first thing I did when I entered high school was join the Robotech Robot Making Club.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,640
We get together after school every day and create our own robots.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,800
Nowadays, it is very easy to find kits to build your own robot, and these are what we use.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,400
The highlight of the year for us is the annual Robot Maze Race.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,240
Everyone who wants to take part has to make a small computer-controlled robot.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,800
You need to race it to the center of a maze.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
We work together in teams of three or four.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,600
This year, I am working with two students who won last year's competition,

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
so I think we have a really good chance of winning.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,320
Our robot is about 30 centimeters high.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
It weighs 2 kilograms. It should be really quick.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,160
We have been practicing often, and we have already equalled last year's speed,

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
so we just need to get a little faster.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,480
We are keeping the design of our robot secret.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,920
If we win, we will get $500. I hope this will be my lucky year.

Unit 9 Online Chatting

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,960
Philip, are you still chatting online?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,560
It's 9.30pm. You have an exam tomorrow.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,360
Yes, Mom. I'll get off in a minute.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
I read some articles about chatting online.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,040
I'm not so sure you should be spending so much time in front of your computer.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,360
Mom, that seems unfair. It can be very educational.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,160
You meet people from all over the world who talk about lots of different things.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,360
Okay, maybe these people share their knowledge.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,440
I still think it is better to join clubs and socialize with real people.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,280
Do you think chatting online causes bad behavior?

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Online chatting can be very addictive, not to mention expensive.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Well, if you have DSL, chatting is not expensive.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,440
Also, not everyone who chats is an addict.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,200
Disabled people are better able to socialize online.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,520
You know, not every area is wheelchair accessible.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,960
True. However, I've read that there are lots of strange people online who are dangerous.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,880
I'll be careful. Besides, you can always see what I'm writing and who I'm writing to.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,480
In my opinion, the biggest fault with chatting online is the lag time or delay in the system.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,080
I agree. I have noticed that there is some lag time in you getting off the computer.

Unit 10, The Nobel Prize

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,960
One of the greatest achievements in the world is to win the Nobel Prize.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,520
It has been given to people since 1901.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,600
There are prizes for physics, chemistry and medicine.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,200
There are also prizes for literature, economics and peace.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,040
The Nobel Prize is named after Alfred Nobel.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,120
He was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1833.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,640
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite in 1866.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,960
Dynamite is used in mining, construction and war.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,320
Before he died, he wrote that all of his money should be used to create the Nobel Prize.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,760
He died in 1896.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,360
The first prize was given in 1901.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,960
Each prize has three parts, a diploma, a gold medal and money.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,240
The money has increased since 1980.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,200
It is now 10 million Swedish crowns.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,680
This is about 1 million euros.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,160
How are the winners chosen?

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,000
Five committees secretly meet to pick the winners.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,200
The Nobel Prize for Economics is the only one that is not decided that way.

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,480
That is because it was created in 1956 by the Bank of Sweden

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,280
in honor of the 50th anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,880
The Bank of Sweden decides who gets the Nobel Prize for Economics.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,440
Since 1901, over 750 people have won the Nobel Prize.

Unit 11. Great Art

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What makes a painting a great work of art?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are many answers to that question.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Some people think that a painting should look pretty.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Others disagree.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The skill of the painter is important.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The techniques used are also important.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Most of all, a great painting has meaning.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A painting has a special element in it.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sometimes, a painter's special element

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is the way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of art.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
An example of this is Picasso's painting, Guernica.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It has strange shapes in it.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It shows suffering people too.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is not a very pretty picture.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
However, it makes people understand Picasso's feelings about war.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Other times, the element is a memory or feeling.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This comes from inside another person.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Someone may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful memory.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A painting can also remind people of a feeling.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For example, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is very popular.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Many people like her smile.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Some people say it is a mysterious smile.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Others say it is a happy one.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Still, others make up stories about the woman in the painting.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which element is the most important?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is it the skill of the artist

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
or the feelings of the person looking at the painting?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Whatever the case, a painting that grabs people's emotions is popular.

I want to be a member of a heavy metal band.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
I love heavy metal drums, James.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I don't, Henry. They are too heavy if you ask me.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I prefer a more traditional style, like African barrel drums.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
Barrel drums? What are those?

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
They are made with hollow logs and animal skins.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
First, they cut down a tree.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They cut a section that's about as thick and tall as a barrel.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,500
They stretch an animal skin over the top and tie it to the sides with wooden pegs.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
These pegs can be tightened to change the pitch.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hmm, that sounds interesting.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,500
In Nigeria, they have talking drums.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
They use a hollow tree trunk that's smaller than a barrel drum

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,500
and leave an opening at both ends.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Then they fit an animal skin on each end.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
There's a string between each of these ends.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,500
When a player holds the drum under an armpit and squeezes,

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
it tightens the string and raises the pitch.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Why do they call it a talking drum?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
The drummers are so skillful, they can make the drums imitate human voices.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
They seem to cry, laugh, and shout.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'd like to hear that.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Why don't you come to the community college with me tomorrow?

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
A troupe from Africa is giving a concert,

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
and they are supposed to have the best drummers in the world.

27

The latest blockbuster movie, Robots Attack 2, starring Garrison Fort, opened yesterday.

Fort and Andy Robot are at it again, saving people from the jaws of death.

The evil robots are invading Atlantis once again.

5

The crowds seem to love the sequel.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,680
Maybe they loved it as much, if not more, than the first robots attack.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,760
The special effects are fantastic.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
Mr. Fort seems to have worked on his fighting technique.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,160
His martial arts skills are amazing.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,920
He beats the evil robots easily.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,880
Of course, our leading man saves a lady in distress, the fair Angie.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,200
She promptly falls in love with Garrison the hero.

13

However, Andy Robot is jealous of this new love.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,240
He spends a good part of the movie trying to ruin their plans.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,800
Another surprise is the evil robot Homer, who decides he wants to become a do-gooder.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,920
His partner, Ethel, works hard to make him return to his evil ways.

What about Ethel?

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,440
Does she bring Homer back to his evil ways?

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,800
To find out, head for the theater, buy a ticket, and sit back and relax.

It happens a lot.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,400
So many people visit and live in foreign countries nowadays.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,720
The culture and manners of every country are different.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,360
It is likely that a foreigner will say or do something inappropriate.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,600
This is called a faux pas.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,360
In one culture, it is fine to do something one way.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,320
In another culture, it is rude.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,560
For example, my friend visited a relative in Israel.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,040
She offered to wash the dishes.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
She did not know that it was important to wash the meat dishes with a special sponge.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
She used the wrong sponge.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Her friend's father was very upset.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,200
In Canada, it is fine to use the same sponge to wash all of the dishes, but not in Israel.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,240
Something similar happened to me when I visited a temple in India.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,560
I was surprised when two officials stopped me and told me to take off my shoes.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,280
It was only then that I realized that people are not allowed to enter a temple with their shoes on.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,440
I was very embarrassed.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
Of course, I apologized for my mistake.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,400
A faux pas is embarrassing.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,840
No one wants to be rude.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
No one wants to cause problems.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,200
However, when two cultures meet, there can be misunderstandings.

The next time someone is rude, be patient and understanding.

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,680
He may think he is acting politely.

00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,240
Thanks for coming dad. I can't believe my first day of school is just next week

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,460
Your mother and I are proud of you Greer is a very prestigious art school

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,600
There is an enormous list of art supplies. They are mostly items. I don't recognize

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:28,480
Let's look for the supplies that you recognize Megan and then we can get help with the rest. I need a large drawing board

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,280
I also need a drawing pad one meter by half a meter in size

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,560
Newsprint paper and a set of artists drawing pencils here is the drawing board and I noticed the pencils over there

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,800
What's next? I need watercolor paint various brushes India ink and a fountain pen

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
They are on the wall display

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,600
Now we need to locate the vine charcoal

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,800
Excuse me miss

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,680
We're trying to find vine charcoal. Do you know what that is and where we can find it?

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,680
Vine charcoal is specially burned wood

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Burning it makes it like a black chalk. It is commonly used for drawing

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,680
Vine charcoal is very easy to erase so we keep it next to the erasers

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,800
That's everything dad. Great. Let's pay for all these supplies

There are many popular leisure time activities,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,200
but one of the most enjoyable is family time.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,520
Most people enjoy being with their families.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,160
There are many things to do with your family too. Families can go to the movies,

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
travel, visit museums, and play sports together.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,840
The most common family activity is probably camping.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
Many families like camping. It is a chance for the whole family to work together.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,800
They can stay in the wild, children gather dry wood for the fire,

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,560
their parents set up the tents, then the whole family gathers around the fire.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,000
They enjoy a special meal together. Then,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,360
they set off into the woods with a compass and a map.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,520
After hiking the trails, everyone gets a fishing pole,

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,680
each person casts the fishing line out into the river.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,800
Who gets the biggest fish? It's a great contest.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,360
Later, the children clean the fish by the river.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,560
They take the scales off the fish, mom fries the fish over the campfire,

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
dad cleans up when everyone is finished.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,880
You don't want wild animals coming to eat your leftovers,

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,720
then everyone goes into their tents for a restful night.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,480
While there are many things that families can do together,

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,960
camping is probably the most exciting.

I am having a fantastic time.

There's that new ride.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,840
It's called The Volcano, and it's supposed to be amazing.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,960
That looks awfully high.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,840
Do you really want to try it?

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,960
We've experienced the rocket, the giant ferris wheel, and those bumper boats.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,680
Don't you think that's enough?

Besides, I am absolutely starving.

12

If you come on The Volcano with me, I'll buy you a pizza with whatever toppings you want.

Do you really mean any topping?

14

Even mushrooms, which you don't like?

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,800
Yes, I will even order a pizza with mushrooms.

Great, Fran. I know you will enjoy this.

19

I heard it is quite an experience.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,520
I am not sure that I want to get on this ride anymore.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,280
Don't worry, Fran.

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,680
Look at the people getting off the ride.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
They look very satisfied.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this, even for pizza.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,560
How would you feel if I bought lunch instead?

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,320
I don't want to force you to do something you really don't want to do, and I am hungry.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
Sure, let's get some lunch.

Why don't we start a lemonade stand, Will?

That's a great idea, Mary, but do you think we will make any money?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,700
If we set up in an area with a lot of traffic on a hot day, we will get plenty of customers.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,300
We can charge $1.50 per cup.

That sounds a little expensive.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,900
But we need to charge that much to cover our expenses.

By charging $1.50 per cup, we can make good money with our lemonade stand.

Okay, what do we need to get started?

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,200
We need the ingredients to make lemonade.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
So we need lemons, sugar, and water.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:56,900
We need something to keep our money in, a sign to advertise the lemonade, paper cups, and a cardboard box to use as a stand.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Should we sell food to go with the lemonade?

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,900
I think that would be too complicated.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,900
We would need a permit and either a cooler or stove.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,900
We should stick to just selling lemonade.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,900
You're right. Let's just keep it simple.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,400
Okay, let's get set up and think of a plan to get some customers and make some sales.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,400
Why don't I attract the customers and you serve the lemonade?

Sounds good to me.

I insist. Did you want cream and sugar in your coffee?

Well, thank you very much. No cream in the coffee, please.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,800
So you probably don't want sugar either.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,400
No, I think there is enough sugar in the brownies. I'll find us some seats near the aisle.

5

keep your knees bent and your body low. It helps you keep your balance

20

Playing defense is hard work. Take a break, then we'll try it again.

Unit 22. The Importance of Writing

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,760
This is terrible! I hate this assignment!

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,120
What's wrong, Timmy?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm frustrated because I need to write a book report and I can't get started.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,680
May I see your paper?

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,680
There's nothing here!

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,280
I can't think of anything to write and it's due tomorrow!

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,440
To make matters worse, we have to perform an oral presentation in front of the entire class.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,720
I don't see the purpose of writing a book report anyway.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,040
Writing is a necessary skill that you'll use for the rest of your life.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,200
This book report is just one way to begin learning that skill.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
It's another form of communication and a means of expressing your thoughts.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,440
It allows others to understand what is in your heart and mind.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
I've never had to write before. Why should I start now?

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
Now is the best time to begin.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
The best writers read a lot and practice writing.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
Anyone can learn to write well. I know you can do it.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,440
Okay, Mom. When you put it that way, I think I can do it.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,200
That's the right attitude.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Let's try to organize some of your thoughts by brainstorming.

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,320
What can you tell me about the book?

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
The book? I've only watched the movie. Does that count?

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh goodness! What kind of child am I raising?

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,040
One that probably won't be a famous writer.

It's so difficult to choose what courses to take this semester.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,040
Henry, have you chosen all of your courses yet?

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,840
No, Sue. I'm having a hard time making up my mind,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,440
and I still need to select two more.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do you have any ideas? Do you know anything about the professors?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,300
I heard that the psychology professor is tough but fair.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,300
If you work hard, you can get a good grade.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,800
Psychology sounds interesting.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,600
How about we both sign up for psychology?

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Then we'd be in the same class, and we could help each other with assignments.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,000
I remember the last class we took together.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,800
Oh, come on. It would be fun.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I promise I'll attend the classes and not just borrow your notes this time.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,300
Thanks.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,800
I was thinking about taking film studies. Why don't you take that?

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,800
I like going to the movies, but I don't want to study them.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,800
I know someone who took that course last year, and she said it's very easy.

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,300
Almost everyone gets an A or a B, and there is no homework.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,300
That is tempting, but I want to learn something useful.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,800
Fine, but don't complain to me if you get a C.

Thanksgiving is a special family holiday in America.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Families come together to give thanks for all they have.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Although every family celebrates in slightly different ways,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
a typical Thanksgiving is full of food, family, and fun.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,500
My family celebrates Thanksgiving too.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Everyone in my family goes to my parents' place for Thanksgiving.

We have a large meal.

9

Everyone helps on Thanksgiving.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
The children set the table.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
My mother cooks the turkey using her own secret ingredients.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,000
My father makes the side dishes.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He makes potatoes, beans, carrots, stuffing, oysters, and beets.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
My mom makes cranberry sauce.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
My sister-in-law brings a pumpkin pie.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
I come early to help my parents cook.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
When it is time to eat, we put all the food on the table.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Everyone sits down.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We each say what we are thankful for before we eat.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Some of us are thankful for our health,

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
and others are thankful for their jobs.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Everyone is thankful for something different.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
There is a lot of activity after the meal.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
My aunt and uncle clean off the table.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,000
My sister-in-law helps me wash the dishes.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The teenagers wash and put away the silverware.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The children help to tidy the dining room.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,500
My brothers take out the garbage.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Then they go play football in the backyard.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
The rest of us sit down and relax.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,000
We are thankful for the food and our blessings.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Most of all, we are thankful to have each other.

Hey Dad, do you think you can help me out?

I've just been assigned this enormous project at school

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000
and I really don't know where to begin.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,560
Sure Jason, I'll give it my best shot.

Oh Dad, I know you'll be a great help and inspiration to me.

What's this project about?

Well, I have two choices.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,880
I can research a profession

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,560
or I can interview someone that I admire about their profession.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,120
If I do the second option,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
I must also add my own opinion about their profession.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,240
Well, I am an expert when it comes to my profession.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,720
Accounting is a noble profession

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,520
and one that I am always happy to talk about.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,640
Dad, I know how much you love your career.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
It isn't that I don't admire you,

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
but what I was hoping actually

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,880
was that you could speak to Mr. Chang, your diving friend

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
and see if he would agree to an interview.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Diving for a living sounds cool.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
I see, that's a great idea.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,440
You know how I really dislike talking about myself for too long?

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,120
Let me give David Chang a call right now and find out.

26

Hello, Wendy. Who did you do your homework about?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I wrote about my dad because he is a firefighter.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Really? Does he actually go into burning buildings?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, and he sometimes has to crawl into tight places to rescue people.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Has he ever been trapped in a burning building?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, one time he needed to break down a door.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He was carrying a little girl out of her house.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Someone left the stove on and it ignited a fire in the kitchen.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Was everyone alright?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
All five people living there escaped safely, but the house burned to the ground.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Your dad is incredibly brave, a real hero. What does he do at the fire station?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He resides there for a few days when he works.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All of the firefighters cook, eat and clean together.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When there's a fire, they slide down a pole into the fire station's garage to get their firefighting equipment.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They quickly put on their gear and then jump onto the fire trucks.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My dad loves to drive the fire trucks.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wow, maybe I should be a firefighter someday.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm definitely going to be a firefighter, Ian. I want to be just like my dad.

Theron Lee's mother hoped her daughter would follow in her footsteps and become a doctor.

However, Theron always knew she wanted to sing.

In her spare time, Theron sang along with pop songs.

Theron also entered singing contests.

She won many competitions.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,000
Her big break came after high school.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,640
She was on vacation in Hong Kong and took second place in an important singing competition.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,600
She got a recording contract with Fancy Pie Records and, a few years later, Sony.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,640
Today, Coco Lee, as she is now known, is one of the most famous pop singers in the world.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,880
She was born in Hong Kong on January 17, 1975, but she was raised in San Francisco.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,560
She has made records in English and Chinese.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:08,320
Her 1998 album, Didadee, won the MTV Asia Music Award for Best Album and Best Music Video.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
Coco's next album was in English.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,160
It was called Just No Other Way.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
It introduced her to American audiences.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,280
Apart from her beautiful voice and stunning looks, Coco Lee is intelligent.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,960
She had a 3.8 grade point average in college.

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,320
She also earned a double major in biochemistry and bioscience.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,000
One of her dreams, she says, is to help find a cure for cancer.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,720
Who knows? Coco's mother may yet get her wish.

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,300
The conductor was not pleased with my last performance.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,200
Besides, don't you think it's too soon?

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,100
Not at all. You might just need to get out and socialize.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,100
Hey, I've got a fabulous idea.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,100
Oh no, not another one of your ideas.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,900
What is it this time?

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,100
Do you remember me telling you about Julia, a friend from work?

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
I think so. Why?

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,500
Well, she is single. I could set up the two of you.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,900
A blind date? I tried that when I was younger and it was a disaster.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Come on, Mike. I'd be helping two friends who will, of course, have a great time together.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,900
She has a charming personality, and she also plays the oboe.

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,500
You can go to the concert in the park on Saturday afternoon.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Maybe you can have coffee afterwards.

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,900
She plays the oboe? Okay, let me know when and where to meet her.

Unit 29. Crime does not pay.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,500
Have you ever thought about committing a crime?

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,500
Have you ever dreamed about holding up a bank and driving away in a fast car?

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,700
Or have you ever thought about taking a famous painting from a big museum?

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
There are many stories in movies and on TV of criminals who make a lot of money.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,400
They go on to live a life of luxury.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,400
However, for every successful criminal, there are many, many more who fail.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,400
These crooks soon regret their crimes.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Take the example of a man in Winnipeg who tried to break into cars in a police academy parking lot.

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,400
The man was found by the police in the parking lot.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,900
They saw him trying to open the doors of all the cars.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,400
The man was hoping to find some loose change or maybe take some good car stereos.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,400
However, he did not know that he was being watched by police officers.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
He chose the parking lot because it was in a very quiet area.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,400
He thought that no one would see him.

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
He was soon arrested by the police.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,400
A foolish criminal like this man shows us that crime does not pay.

Hello, Ms. Jones, please come in and sit down.

Thank you.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,000
So you're applying for the position of computer technician?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Yes, that's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
My name is Mr. Smith, and I will be interviewing you today.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,000
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,400
As my resume shows, I graduated from Leeds University with a computer science degree.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,400
During my junior and senior years, I worked part-time as a computer lab monitor in the university.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,400
As part of that job, I helped students with PC and desktop application problems

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
and did hardware and software maintenance.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I also taught a weekly one-hour class on how to use Microsoft Office applications.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,400
How would you describe yourself?

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,400
I really enjoy problem-solving, and I'm hard-working.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm also very organized, so when I have a lot of problems to deal with,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,400
I make a list and work through it from the most to the least urgent.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
That way, I can get everything done within the set deadlines.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
That's a good way to manage your time.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Just one more question.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Why do you want to work for us?

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Your company is well-known and is respected in the computer industry.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I would really like a chance to be part of your company.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Okay, thank you for coming in. I'll be in touch.

Hi Sandy, I have a question for you.

4

Sure Joe.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I need to have a physical examination and there is a new clinic on Elm Street.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Have you heard anything about it?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One of my friends went there recently.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
She said it was very hygienic and well run.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is great to have a new clinic close by.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Since there is a shortage of doctors around here, why are you going?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've just joined a gym.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to get more exercise and they require a medical exam before I can start.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What kind of tests do they want you to have?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They want to know my blood pressure, how much I weigh, and results from a blood test to check for any possible diseases.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I feel terrific so I'm not worried.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I had a routine check up last month and the doctor discovered that my blood pressure is a little high.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's not serious but I am glad that I found out about it.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am walking every day and I have to cut down on my salt intake.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I would rather not take medicine if I don't have to.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The change in diet has really made me feel better.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You know the saying, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think you are right.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Prevention is very important.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to call right now and set up an appointment.

Everyone wants to be healthy. People see doctors. They take pills to stay healthy.

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,140
However, plants have been used to heal for thousands of years.

More and more people are trying herbs to stay healthy.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,660
Plants used to heal are called herbal medicine.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,660
There are many plants used in herbal medicine. Each plant is used in a certain way.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,660
Herbal medicine works more slowly than most pills.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,660
Many people think plants are gentle on the body.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,660
There are a lot of examples of helpful plants.

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,660
Ginger can help your body. Eating ginger often may help you stay healthy.

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,660
Another helpful plant is parsley. It can stop bad breath.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,660
Herbs may be gentler than some pills.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,660
However, this does not mean that anyone can take them in any way.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,660
You should always be careful. Some herbs can be harmful too.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,660
Too much rosemary can be very bad for your stomach. It can make you sick.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,660
Foxglove is a very pretty flower. It also has poison in it.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,660
Nevertheless, if you are afraid of using herbs, you may be surprised.

18
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,660
You have probably already used some kind of herbal medicine.

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,660
Coffee, garlic, jinseng, and peppermint are all used in herbal medicine.

20
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Herbal medicine is becoming popular again as people become more interested in their health.

It is then crushed.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,900
The ginger is boiled for about 30 minutes.

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,600
Some honey can be added after it is done.

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,100

That's interesting, but you should remember that one study does not prove much.

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,640
and may relieve headaches too.

I know that some coffee can be good sometimes,

17

but drinking too much is not beneficial.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,080
Coffee has a lot of caffeine, which is addictive.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,960
It affects your blood circulation and removes calcium from your bones.

20

The doctor did admit that it is not for everyone,

21

Unit 35, Soccer Rules

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,800
Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Although the main idea of the game is easy to understand,

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,800
there are many rules to be followed.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,880
A player gets a yellow card for not following the rules.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,960
A yellow card is a warning.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,840
If a player keeps breaking the rules, he gets a red card.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,680
When this happens, he cannot play anymore.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,600
He is ejected from the game.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Another rule is about handling.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,720
Handling is when another player touches a ball with his hands on purpose.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,880
Players cannot handle the ball.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,000
A player may not do anything that is dangerous to another player.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,080
He cannot kick an opponent's leg to get the ball.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,120
There are also some lesser known rules.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,400
A player is not allowed to impede an opponent.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,680
This means that a player cannot purposely slow down another player on the field.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,600
A penalty can be called if this occurs.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,680
There is a rule about blocking a goalkeeper too.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,040
A yellow card or an indirect kick can be given to the opponent's team if the player tries this.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Yes, soccer is full of rules.

Unit 36 Visit Frisco City

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,840
Frisco City is the place for your next vacation.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,520
The city has lots of shopping, food, and fun.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,680
There are so many things to do. The river walk is a must-see.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,600
Take a city bus to any of the three downtown stops.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,800
There you will find stairs. The stairs go down to the river side.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,240
There are about 5 kilometers of sidewalk on either side of the river.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,400
Palm trees and cypress trees decorate the area.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,040
There are also tropical plants.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,880
You will see many unique shops, casual cafes, and upscale restaurants.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,040
Every shop is different. You can ride one of the riverboats

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,840
and hear a guide talk about the history of the river walk.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,200
However, the river walk is only one of the attractions of Frisco City.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,480
There are also two amusement parks just outside Frisco City.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,200
You can enjoy a day of fun in the sun at Water World Park.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,800
You can also spend the day enjoying the roller coasters

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,000
and other rides at Sunland.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,960
Visit Frisco City. You will have a great time!

Unit 37. Asking for directions

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,240
Asking for directions can be risky. I realized exactly how risky it could be when I needed

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,880
to meet one of my friends one day. A while ago, I arranged to meet my friend at a new mall.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,320
My friend had been there before and indicated that we should shop there together.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,960
We planned to meet at 3pm at Burger Palace in the mall.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,280
When I arrived at the mall, I realized I did not know where Burger Palace was,

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,600
so I asked a woman for directions. She advised me to go straight past the bank

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,120
and turn right before the food court. She mentioned that I would walk for a few minutes,

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,080
passing a shoe store, until I reached Burger Palace, which was next to the bookstore.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,680
I followed her directions and arrived just in time.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,720
Twenty minutes later, I was beginning to wonder where my friend was.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Thirty minutes later, I was worried. I did not know what to do, so I just kept waiting.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,800
At around 3.40pm, I saw my friend walking quickly toward me. I rushed to him and

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,160
demanded to know what happened. I was at the other Burger Palace, he cried.

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,720
We had not realized there were two Burger Palaces in the mall.

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Since then, I have made sure that I get the directions from my friends before I go to meet them.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,840
It saves me a lot of trouble.

Unit 38, fixing a flat.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,300
When your car gets a flat tire, do not panic.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,400
First apply your brakes and pull over.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Inside the trunk, you will find a spare tire and a toolbox.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,900
One of these tools is a jack, which is a tool you use to raise the car.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,600
This makes the tire easy to remove.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Position the jack beneath the car behind the tire that is flat.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,900
Insert the jack handle and turn it clockwise.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,200
Continue turning the handle until the car rises high enough

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
so that the flat tire is well off the ground and spins freely.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,300
Make sure that the jack is securely supporting the vehicle.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,600
If the car is unsteady or the jack is unstable, lower the car.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,900
Reposition the jack and begin again.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,700
Next, use a crowbar to pry off the hubcap, the metal cover on the side of the tire.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,100
Inside the hubcap are four bolts that hold the tire in place.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Loosen these using the long L-shaped tool.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,700
Push firmly on the tool to get the bolts to turn.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,000
It may be difficult.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,700
Once the bolts are loose, the flat tire can be pulled off easily.

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,500
Now you can put on the new tire.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Once it is in place, replace the four bolts and tighten them.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,300
Place the flat tire and the toolbox back in the trunk.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:44,500
Finally, drive to the nearest service station and get your flat tire fixed.

Welcome to the Atlanta International Airport, ma'am.

How may I help you?

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,760
I am traveling to Venezuela.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,640
Can you tell me what the exchange rate is for the dollar?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,200
One moment, please, and I will look it up.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,600
The currency in Venezuela is the bolivar.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,040
The exchange rate is 200 bolivars per dollar.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,960
That seems rather low.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,560
Are you certain that that is all the dollar is worth?

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,040
There may be several local businesses that may exchange for a higher rate,

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,800
but the official rate is the one I gave you.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
Can I exchange $100?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
I need to have some money for a taxi and a hotel once I arrive in Caracas.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,160
No problem. Here is your money.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,480
Would you like a receipt?

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,680
Yes, please.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,800
I will need it to keep track of my business expenses.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,160
Is there anything else I can do for you?

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,400
I just have one more question.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,800
Do you know where I can exchange dollars in Venezuela once I arrive?

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,320
I will probably need more cash, and I want to find a reliable exchange.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,040
The best place to exchange money is at a large bank.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,760
They will always give you the official rate.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,720
You can also find money exchange stores in most large cities.

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,400
Wonderful. I will look for a bank.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,480
I appreciate your advice.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,600
My pleasure.

It is where the First Nations people used to live.

Now, a visitor's center is there.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,700
There is also an archaeology lab and walking trails.

7

8

The displays show everyday activities.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
They show how the people lived.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,200
The gift shop in the visitor's center sells crafts made by the First Nations people.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,700
There are jewelry, paintings, and pottery.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,200
You can also eat at the restaurant.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,200

There are also wild rice dishes, fruit pies, and traditional bread.

15

All of the food is tasty.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,700
The archaeology lab is run by the local university.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,700
A big window lets you see the archaeologists working.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,700
They found a very old spearhead.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,700
They also found ancient human bones.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,700
You can learn about the First Nations culture.

22

You can also see archaeologists at work.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,200
You can walk on the trails or enjoy a traditional meal.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,700
It is an experience to remember.
