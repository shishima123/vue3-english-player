Unit 1, Antarctica.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Antarctica is another name for the South Pole. It is also a continent.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A long time ago, the South Pole was close to the equator.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That was 500 million years ago. It was once joined to Australia.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then, all the land on Earth started to move.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Antarctica moved away from Australia and went south.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Dinosaur bones were once found at the South Pole. Do you know why?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Dinosaurs lived there millions of years ago. This was before it moved away from the equator.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
About 98% of this continent is frozen. The rest is made up of rock.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The South Pole has 87% of the world's ice. But did you know that it gets very little snow?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Only about 2 inches of snow falls each year.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How many people live on your continent? No one lives in the South Pole.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Only animals like penguins live there.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Scientists and tourists visit there, but they don't stay long.

The hiking club is going to Bear Mountain.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,280
The bus drops us off at the bottom and we're going to hike until we get to a cabin, halfway up the mountain.

That sounds really great. Where can I sign up?

What activity will we do when we get to the cabin on the mountain?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,920
Well, it takes seven hours to hike to the cabin, so it will be late by the time we arrive.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,760
After we unpack, we'll start a campfire.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,000
Then we can sing, eat and tell stories around the fire.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,400
The following day, we'll leave it dawn and hike to the top of the mountain.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,760
After we take pictures, we'll hike back down.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
If we have time, we might go swimming in the lake on the mountain.

15

No, what is the story?

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,800
Turtles are in danger of becoming extinct around the world.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,480
Every year, thousands of turtles lay eggs on the beach.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,320
After the turtles lay their eggs in the sand, people come along and take them.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,160
I suppose the people like eating turtle eggs.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,240
Exactly. Turtles are beginning to stay away from certain places now.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,160
There are fewer and fewer of them left.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,640
There is a new project in Mexico to save these eggs.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,240

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,840

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm going to call the Environmental Protection Hotline.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,520
They might have some information about the project to help save turtles in Mexico.

16

Last year, I went hiking in Iran.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,720
Iran has many mountains.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,120
You can find trees that lose their leaves in winter.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,880
If you're lucky, you may see a yellow deer or a brown bear.

8

Two species that live there.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,600
The air is fresh and you can swim in clear, clean lakes.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I definitely recommend it.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,360
There are so many birds to see.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,040
It is fun to go into the forest with binoculars to look at birds.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,920
Seeing the birds through binoculars makes them seem much nearer than they actually are.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,440
You can write down all of the species that you see.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,480
You should learn about their calls first.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,160
That means the sounds that each bird makes.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,080
Sometimes it's hard to see the birds.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,320
However, you can identify them if you happen to hear them.

19

She discovered many new things about them.

14

She learned that each chimp has its own personality.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
She saw that they have feelings.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,600
Jane discovered that chimps have very close families.

17

Mothers and fathers take good care of baby chimps.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,800
An adult female chimp will sometimes adopt an orphan.

19

Plate, bowls, and pots go face down on the bottom rack.

Then, fill this compartment with detergent and close the door.

Next, choose the wash cycle and finally press the start button.

help you? 
M: I would like to buy my wife a home appliance
for her birthday.
W: What sort of appliance are you looking for, sir?
M: I think a dishwasher might be the perfect gift
because it will help with the housework.
W: Oh yes, dishwashers are very useful. This one
here is our most popular model.
M: How does it work?
W: It’s very simple. First, collect your dirty dishes
and scrape off the leftover food into the garbage
can. Then, rinse the dishes in the sink. Put glasses,
cups, and cutlery on the top rack. Plates, bowls,
and pots go face down on the bottom rack. Then,
fill this compartment with detergent and close the
door. Next, choose the wash cycle, and finally,
press the start button. You’ll have sparkling clean
dishes in 45 minutes!

Unit 14, an outdoor exhibit.

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,200
Do you like photographs?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,800
What kind of photos?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,680
Photos of plants and animals, for example.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,800
Or mountains and oceans.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,200
The sort of photographs a nature magazine would publish.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,240
That's right.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,800
Of course, I love nature photos.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,240
They are very beautiful.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,400
Some of them are very colorful.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, most nature photos are so interesting.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,000
Sometimes I buy nature magazines just for the photos.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Me too.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like taking nature photos with my camera,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but they are not very good.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,200
My photos are not good either.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Famous nature magazines only publish very good photos.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's true.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
People must be very talented to get their photos published.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,800
Why are we suddenly talking about photographs?

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,600
Is there an exhibit somewhere?

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
How did you guess?

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There is an outdoor exhibit going on right now.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Really?

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,400
Yes, nature photographs from all over the world are on display.

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,000
That sounds great.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,800
I would love to see it.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Me too.

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,600
Would you like to go with me?

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Sure.

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
How about Sunday morning?

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000

There are more than six billion human beings in the world.

Each one is different from all the others.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,480
No two people look exactly alike.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,680
People from one country may look the same in general,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,320
but they are not totally alike.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,820
Most people in Vietnam have straight black hair and black eyes.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,420
But they all look different.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,220

We all think differently.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,940
We all like different things.

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,040
We like different kinds of food and different kinds of music.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,340
We also like different styles of clothing.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,800
Wherever you are, you are different from everyone else.

19

Nobody else looks just like you.

I've been very well, thank you. How are you, Dan?

I had never gone karaoke singing before either, but I had a great time.

My friends were experienced karaoke singers, so they showed me what to do.

Did you have to sing in front of a lot of strangers?

12

No. The place we went to rented out small private rooms.

13

Nobody else could hear us. They even gave us free sodas.

Cool. What kind of music did they have?

15

They had hundreds of different songs to choose from.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They had both new songs and old songs.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They had songs in English and songs in several other languages too.

next Saturday.
M: Did I hear you correctly? You have two tickets
to the baseball game? How did you get those? I
thought it was impossible to get tickets because
they were all sold out last month!
W: It was easy, actually. My colleague and her
husband have to go to London that week, so
they’ll miss the game. They offered me their
tickets, and of course I was happy to accept.
M: You’re so lucky! Who are you going to take with
you?
W: I was thinking that maybe you would like to go.
Otherwise, I might take my brother instead.
M: Don’t do that, I would love to watch the game
with you! 
W: I was just joking. I know you really want to go.
Where shall we meet on Saturday?
M: Well, the game starts at nine o’clock in the

Comic book heroes have been popular for many years.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,300
One hero has the strength of 100 men.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,000
This hero also has the speed of lightning.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This hero cannot be killed.

8

A man called William Marston created Wonder Woman in 1941.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,500
He was a graduate of Harvard University.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,000
He used a false name on his comics.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
He did not want his colleagues to know that he wrote comics.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,000
The false name was Charles Moulton.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Mr. Marston wanted to make a strong female hero for little girls.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Of course, he hoped that little boys would like Wonder Woman too.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Wonder Woman was not very popular at first.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Then, World War II began in 1941.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Wonder Woman became a role model for children around the world.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
She was both strong and beautiful.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
She always tried to do what was right.

20

Thanks for meeting me today, Professor. I don't understand last week's lecture on blood types. Could you please explain it to me?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No problem, Angela. First, let's see what you do understand. Can you tell me about blood types?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are four types of blood. A, B, A, B, and O.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Good. How is your blood type determined?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You get your blood type from both your parents. Your blood type is a combination of genes from your father and your mother.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's right.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Before the lecture, I always thought that all blood was the same. Why can't two different blood types mix?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In some ways, every person's blood is the same, but it is very dangerous to mix two different blood types.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Your blood cells may begin to stick together. If you are given the wrong type of blood in a hospital, you could die.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I see. So that's why blood types must be matched in the hospital, and this must be done before blood is given to anyone.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Exactly.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
When I was 12 years old, I read an article about how the human brain works.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,000
I studied very hard. I tried to use my brain well.

I liked spending time with children and helping them learn and grow.

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,300
I need to lose weight too and I've always wanted to take yoga classes.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,500
Do you know if the new gym offers yoga classes?

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I'm not sure. I'm planning to go there on Friday evening to look around. Do you want to join me?

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Let me check my schedule for this week. I'm too busy on Friday, so can we go on Saturday afternoon instead?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Sure. We can see what the new gym has to offer and get some exercise too.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,200
It's fun to work out in a gym with other people. We might even meet new people with similar hobbies.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,500
Hold on. Let's see what the gym looks like first before we start planning anything else.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's meet for lunch at the West End Cafe before we go. It might be the last good meal we eat.

Good plan!

No, thank you. I'm working out at a gym these days. I want to be healthy, so I've also started eating good, fresh food.

You're exercising? That's fantastic! When did you start thinking about your weight and staying in shape?

I have lost 7 pounds in one week. Skipping breakfast really works.

I don't think that's a good idea.

4

Why not?

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,700
People who skip breakfast eat more at the next meal.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,300
Eating breakfast is very important.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,800
Breakfast gives you energy for the day.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,100
Well, I eat one big meal a day at dinnertime.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,700
Having one meal a day is not good.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,600
You should have several small meals a day.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,000
You'll have more energy that way.

I only eat salads now.

16

Salads alone may not be nutritious enough.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,700
So what should I eat?

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,400
You need some protein and carbohydrates.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,500
It is important to eat a good variety of food at each meal.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
You should have balanced meals.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,700
Make sure you eat cereals, fruits and vegetables,

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,800
and some bread or rice.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,600
You also need milk and dairy products and some meat.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,700
You'll be healthier.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,100

The license plates on cars in New Mexico also say USA.

    lyric2: `Traveling is a good hobby. If you have very
little money, backpacking is a good way to
travel. Many students like to backpack. They
can travel cheaply. They can travel to many
places. These travelers carry their belongings in
large backpacks. They are called backpackers.
Backpackers take buses or trains to save
money. They camp outdoors to sleep. If they
stay in a city, they may go to a hostel. A hostel
is like a hotel. Hotels are not cheap. Hostels are
very cheap. Travelers often share rooms at hostels.
There are only a few toilets and baths. People
share them, too.
Hostels are a good place to meet other
travelers. You can make friends. They can tell
you about fun things to do in the area. Many
hostels have kitchens. These kitchens have
stoves. Some have toasters. You can buy your
food from a store. Then, you can cook at the
hostel. This is cheaper than eating out. Just
remember to clean up when you are done!`
