Excuse me, ma'am
/ɪkˈskjuz miː mæm/

00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,399
I have a problem with my rose bush
/aɪ hæv ə ˈprɑbləm wɪð maɪ roʊz bʊʃ/

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,600
It used to produce a lot of pink roses
/ɪt juːzd tuː prəˈdus ə lɑt əv pɪŋk ˈroʊzɪz/

5
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,966

This liquid fertilizer is very good
/ðɪs ˈlɪkwɪd ˈfaɪlɪˌzaɪtər ɪz ˈvɛri ɡʊd/

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,266
It will help make your rose leaves green again
/ɪt wɪl hɛlp meɪk jʊər roʊz ˈlivz ɡrin əˈɡɛn/

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,000
Then the plant should produce roses quite soon
/ðɛn ðə plænt ʃʊd prəˈdus ˈroʊzɪz kwaɪt sun/

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,666
The fertilizer costs about $10
/ðə ˈfaɪlɪˌzaɪtər kɒsts əˈbaʊt tɛn ˈdɒlərz/

16
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,199
How long will it take for my rose bush to recover?
/haʊ lɔŋ wɪl ɪt teɪk fɔr maɪ roʊz bʊʃ tuː rɪˈkʌvər/

17

W:   Have you heard about the music festival next summer? I read that it is going to have about 20 different bands playing in it.
M:   I think I did hear someone talking about it. Are you planning on going?
W:   I’ll go if I can get tickets. I heard that people are going to line up overnight to get tickets. I might line up overnight, too.
M:   I don’t think I want to line up all night long!
W:   Well, I’m going to do it. I think it is going to be a great music festival that I won’t want to miss.
M:   Maybe. Do you know how much the tickets are going to cost?
W:   I’m not sure, but I think each ticket will be about $75.
M:   That’s a lot of money! I don’t think I want to spend that much on a ticket. Good luck, anyway!`

I could not use my computer all day

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,366
was it because of a virus

you must be careful when you open files in your email

a virus can make your whole computer crash

11

it was an accident

I didn't know the file had a virus

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,300
I'll be more careful next time

what did you do next

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:48,166
I asked a computer repairman to come to the office

16

he worked all day to repair my computer

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,600

18

lost some of my work

19
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,566
don't worry

20
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,066
your work is probably still on your computer

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,466
I can help you get it back

22
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:07,399

    lyric2: `Racquetball
Racquetball is a popular sport.
It was first played in the US.
This game started just a little more than 50 years ago.
That makes it quite a new sport.
Other racket sports like tennis and squash have been played for a long time.
Racquetball rules are a mix of rules from both handball and squash.
A short racket is used to play this game.
This game became popular almost at once when it first came out.
More and more people wanted to play it.
Clubs began to build racquetball courts.
They built these courts for players of this new sport.
People of all ages can play this game.
But most players today are young people.
Most of them are between the ages of 12 and 34.
Racquetball is now a famous sport.
It is played all over the world.`

you're so lucky Marion

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:10,166
you're leaving for Hawaii in 5 hours

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,166
I never travel because I hate flying in airplanes

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,366
I don't like buses either

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,400
that doesn't matter dean

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,900
there are other ways to get around

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,466
you should take the train somewhere

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,500
that's true it's been a long time since I last traveled

10
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,766
I've always wanted to take a long train trip

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,366
what's stopping you

12
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:38,099
go to the travel agent now and ask about train trips

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,500
what do you think the fares are like

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,666
I'm not sure what train fares are like now

15
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,899
I think it depends on your destination

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,800
that's a question you'll have to ask a travel agent

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,100
can you suggest a good person to talk to

18
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:57,666
my travel agent is always very helpful

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,666
here is his phone number

20
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,599
